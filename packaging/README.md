# Microsoft Store MSIX packaging

This directory contains the Microsoft Store packaging configuration for **Codex Usage Win**.

## Store identity

- Package/Identity/Name: `WalleStudio.CodexUsageWin`
- Package/Identity/Publisher: `CN=2AE5CECF-93C9-4AF7-82E0-23BE2024603E`
- PublisherDisplayName: `Walle Studio`
- Store ID: `9NGSJ2MXF6GS`
- Architecture: `x64`

The package version is derived from `Cargo.toml` and converted from `x.y.z` to `x.y.z.0` for Microsoft Store submission.

## Build

On a Windows machine with the Windows 10/11 SDK installed:

```powershell
cargo build --release
.\packaging\build-msix.ps1 -OutputDir dist
```

The build script creates the required Store assets from `src/icons/256x256.png` and packages the release executable with `MakeAppx.exe`.

## Artifacts

The GitHub Actions workflow produces:

- `codex-usage-win_<version>_x64.msix` — unsigned package for Microsoft Store submission.
- `codex-usage-win_<version>_x64-test-signed.msix` — self-signed package for local installation tests only.
- `codex-usage-win-test.cer` — temporary certificate for the local test package.
- `install-test.ps1` — helper for installing the test certificate and test package.

The self-signed test package is not intended for public distribution. Microsoft Store will sign the Store-distributed package after certification.
